## Aster-Chain Deposit

Deposits are made on the source chain. The deposit method differs by network:

### EVM

Deposits on EVM chains are made by interacting directly with the vault contract on the source chain. There are two ways to deposit:

1. Call the `depositFor` method of the vault contract. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, the deposited asset is credited to the `forAddress` account.
2. Transfer the token directly to the vault contract address. The deposited asset is credited to the sending address.

**Mainnet contract addresses:**

| Chain | Chain ID | Contract Address |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| ETH | 1 | `0x604DD02d620633Ae427888d41bfd15e38483736E` |
| BSC | 56 | `0x128463A60784c4D3f46c23Af3f65Ed859Ba87974` |
| Arbitrum | 42161 | `0x9E36CB86a159d479cEd94Fa05036f235Ac40E1d5` |

**depositFor:**

```solidity
function depositFor(address currency, address forAddress, uint256 amount, uint256 broker) external payable
```

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| currency | ADDRESS | Token contract address. For the native token, pass the fixed placeholder address `0xfdAE1bA7C826aBDc4c99903c8056f82a1A04a615` |
| forAddress | ADDRESS | The user's address that receives the deposited asset |
| amount | UINT256 | Deposit amount in the token's smallest unit (wei). For the native token, it must equal `msg.value` |
| broker | UINT256 | Target account flag: pass `1000` to deposit to the **spot** account; any other value deposits to the **futures** account |

* For ERC20 deposits, `approve` the vault contract to spend the token before calling `depositFor`, and `msg.value` must be `0`.
* For native token deposits, send the amount via `msg.value`; it must equal the `amount` parameter.

### Solana

On Solana, deposits can **only** be made by calling the program methods below. Transferring SOL or tokens directly to the vault address will **not** be credited.

**Mainnet program address:** `EhUtRgu9iEbZXXRpEvDj6n1wnQRjMi2SERDo3c6bmN2c`

There are two deposit methods; both take a single argument `amount` (u64, in the token's smallest unit):

1. `depositSol`: deposit the native token (SOL).
2. `depositToken`: deposit an SPL token (e.g. USDT).

**depositSol accounts:**

| Account | isSigner | isMut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| signer | true | true | The depositor's wallet address; the deposited asset is credited to this address |
| admin | false | false | Admin account |
| solVault | false | true | SOL vault account |
| systemProgram | false | false | Fixed: `11111111111111111111111111111111` |

**depositToken accounts:**

| Account | isSigner | isMut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| signer | true | false | The depositor's wallet address; the deposited asset is credited to this address |
| admin | false | false | Admin account |
| bank | false | false | Bank account of the token |
| tokenVaultAuthority | false | false | Token vault authority |
| tokenVault | false | true | Token vault account |
| depositor | false | true | The depositor's associated token account of `tokenMint` |
| tokenMint | false | false | Token mint address |
| tokenProgram | false | false | Fixed: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` |
| associatedTokenProgram | false | false | Fixed: `ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL` |
| systemProgram | false | false | Fixed: `11111111111111111111111111111111` |

* Target account: for both methods, append the `programId` account (the program address) as the **last** account of the instruction to deposit to the **spot** account; omit it to deposit to the **futures** account.

### SUI

On SUI, only the **spot** account is supported. Deposits are made by transferring the asset directly to your dedicated deposit address — no contract call is required:

1. Call [Get User Deposit Address (USER_DATA)](#get-user-deposit-address-user_data) to get your deposit address on SUI.
2. Transfer the asset directly to that address; once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, it is credited to your spot account.

### Get User Deposit Address (USER_DATA)

```javascript

    "network": "SUI",
